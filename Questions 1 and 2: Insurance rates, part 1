Use the information below as you answer this 6-part question.

An insurance company offers a one-year term life insurance policy that pays $150,000 in the event of death within one year. 
The premium (annual cost) for this policy for a 50 year old female is $1,150. Suppose that in the event of a claim, the company forfeits the premium and 
loses a total of $150,000, and if there is no claim the company gains the premium amount of $1,150. 
The company plans to sell 1,000 policies to this demographic.

Question 1a

The death_prob data frame from the dslabs package contains information about the estimated probability of death within 1 year (prob) for different ages and sexes.

Use death_prob to determine the death probability of a 50 year old female, p.

Answer code:

p <- death_prob %>% filter(sex == "Female", age == 50)
p

Question 1b

The loss in the event of the policy holder's death is -$150,000 and the gain if the policy holder remains alive is the premium $1,150.

What is the expected value of the company's net profit on one policy for a 50 year old female?

Answer code: 

dead <- 0.003193
alive <- 1-dead

e <- (-150000*dead) + (alive*1150)
e

Question 1c

Calculate the standard error of the profit on one policy for a 50 year old female.

Answer code:

abs(-150000-1150)*sqrt(dead*alive)

Question 1d

What is the expected value of the company's profit over all 1,000 policies for 50 year old females?


Answer code:

n <- 1000
e <- (-150000*dead) + (alive*1150)
e * n

Question 1e

What is the standard error of the sum of the expected value over all 1,000 policies for 50 year old females?

Answer code: 

sqrt(n)*(abs(-150000-1150)*sqrt(dead*alive))

Question 1f

Use the Central Limit Theorem to calculate the probability that the insurance company loses money on this set of 1,000 policies.

Answer code:

n <- 1000
avg <- n * (-150000*dead + 1150*alive)
se <- sqrt(n) * (1150 - -150000)*sqrt(dead*alive)
pnorm(0, avg, se)

Question 2a

Use death_prob to determine the probability of death within one year for a 50 year old male.

Answer code:

p <- death_prob %>% filter(sex == "Male", age == 50)

Question 2b

Suppose the company wants its expected profits from 1,000 50 year old males with $150,000 life insurance policies to be $700,000. 
Use the formula for expected value of the sum of draws with the following values and solve for the premium  𝑏 :

E[𝑆]=𝜇𝑆=700000 
𝑛=1000 
𝑝=death probability of age 50 male 
𝑎=150000 
𝑏=premium 
What premium should be charged?

Answer code:

E <- 700000
n <- 1000
a <- -150000
p <- 0.005013
b <- (E/n - (a*p))/(1-p)
b

Question 2c

Using the new 50 year old male premium rate, calculate the standard error of the sum of 1,000 premiums.

Answer code:
SE <- sqrt(n)*(abs(a-b)*sqrt(p*(1-p)))

Question 2d

What is the probability of losing money on a series of 1,000 policies to 50 year old males?
Use the Central Limit Theorem.

avg <- n * ((a*p) + b*(1-p))
se <- sqrt(n) * (b-a)*sqrt(p*(1-p))
pnorm(0, avg, se)
